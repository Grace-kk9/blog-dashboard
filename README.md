# Blog Dashboard

A simple blog dashboard built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Material-UI**, and **RTK Query**. This project demonstrates CRUD operations with a mock API, clean UI using MUI, and proper state management.

##  Design Decisions

- **App Router**: Chose Next.js App Router for cleaner routing and layout structure.
- **Material-UI**: Used MUI for rapid UI development, theming, and responsiveness.
- **RTK Query**: For efficient data fetching, caching, and mutation handling.
- **Client Component Separation**: Created separate client components (e.g. `ClientPostList`) to avoid hydration issues.

---

##  Challenges Faced

- **Hydration Errors**: Encountered hydration mismatches due to MUI and dynamic data. Fixed by carefully wrapping components with `"use client"` and using dynamic imports where necessary.
- **SSR Compatibility**: Had to balance client-only rendering (e.g. post detail fetching) with Next.js' SSR constraints.
- **Live Post Updates**: Initially, new posts didnâ€™t reflect instantly. Solved it by refetching post list after create/update mutations.
- **Git Conflicts**: Faced issues pushing to GitHub after accidentally initializing a README. Resolved merge conflicts and committed successfully.
